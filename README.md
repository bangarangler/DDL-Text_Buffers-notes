# Doubly Linked-List / Text_Buffer

### Text Buffer

1. add chars from front and back
2. remove chars from front and back
3. render content of our buffer
4. concatenate two buffers together (copy/pasting)

### DLL Vs. Array

prepend, append, delete_front, delete_back, join, print

### Doubly Linked List

- append —> O(1)
- prepend —> O(1)
- delete_front —> O(1)
- delete_back —> O(1)
- join —> O(1)
- print —> O(n)

can do more operations faster basically

### Array

- append —> O(1)
- prepend —> O(n)
- delete_front —> O(n)
- delete_back —> O(1)
- join —> O(n)
- print —> O(n)
- computers set up to work better with arrays as a whole though
